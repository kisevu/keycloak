                    **KEYCLOAK**
An Identity and Access Management service.

Right out-of-the-box features it offered in as illustrated with the use of the codes:


1: Single Sign-On (SSO) and Single logout
support for OpenID connect as an identity layer on top of Oauth 2.0 for single sign on and sign logout and one-time authentication.

2: Identity Brokering and Social login
